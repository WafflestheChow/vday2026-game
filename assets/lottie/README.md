Put your Lottie JSON files in this folder.

Suggested file names:
- loading.json
- intro.json
- win.json
- hearts-background.lottie
- cutie-bunnies-love.lottie

The app is configured to load these via:
- /assets/lottie/loading.json
- /assets/lottie/intro.json
- /assets/lottie/win.json
- /assets/lottie/hearts-background.lottie
- /assets/lottie/cutie-bunnies-love.lottie

If a file is missing, the scene still works without that animation.
